Shoelaces are a pain. If you forget to double-tie them, they may come undone, and be a tripping hazard or, at minimum, make you look like an idiot. And if you forget they’re double-tied, it’s easy to make them next to impossible to untie when you yank on the free end, tightening the knot.

But, by lacing them just tight enough, leaving some slack so they can be pulled on and off, you can avoid this hassle every day, or even several times a day if you live in a place where shoes are to be removed when entering. Those minutes can be better used elsewhere.
